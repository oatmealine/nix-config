"phase 1: crying baby and karen
- initially, crying baby is the only one targetable. after being pulled they start the fight with Loud Shriek, which spawns an untargetable Karen at the side of the arena that will do mechanics
- Ungodly Tears places a debuff on 4 random players that will cause affected players to be hit by a moderately sized circle AoE after the debuff wears off
- Karen will cast Unjust Authority which will target all 8 players two consecutive sets of lingering puddles of lipstick that must be baited in a way that does not interfere with resolving the next set of mechanics
- Soundwave targets the closest 4 players with a conal AoE
(both mechanics will resolve at the same time. if a player is hit by both mechanics they will take lethal damage)
- Karen will cast either Divine Coddling or Divine Punishment, if it's Coddling the Crying Baby must be pulled towards Karen, if it's Punishment the Crying Baby must be pulled away from Karen
(This will happen at the same time as Ungodly Tears and Soundwave resolve)
- Crying Baby will cast 3 more Loud Shrieks back to back, and summon a new Karen with each cast (which will all be placed on cardinals or intercardinals outside the arena). Mitigate and heal
- Each Karen, in a clockwise fashion, will cast Just Authority, and then cast Request For The Manager which will fire a beam at the closest player. Players must bait these puddles in a way where players will still be able to bait the beams outside the arena, while not impeding on any future movement required. The catch with Just Authority is that these puddles linger until the end of the phase
- Crying Baby then casts another Soundwave that resolves as the last Karen finishes casting, and then a heavy raidwide called Breakdown that will kill if unmitigated
- Afterwards, Crying Baby will become untargetable and Karen will slam her fist down in the arena, dealing raidwide damage. She then becomes targetable and I'm too lazy to write the rest of this out"

Oat had the goal of becoming the creator of sex 2 by acquiring all known sex in the universe. I do not know if she ever did achieve it for we are still in sex 1 state. However once sex 2 does occur the cycle will increase in speed until 69 is reached."

the vase then broke cus a scriped npc event walked into it, leaving only a mass of sushi that he then molded onto the door entrance penis (this didnt work)
he then used tape and that didnt work either
he found another penis that created a rope from above that he used to swing himself to the door, but then he almost got stuck cus he found out it needs a key which he also found accidentally is created by a penis
put 2 and 2 together, he does the ultimate plan of getting the key, swinging to the door and unlocking it with the help of a plunger. its the wrong key, and the door actually has a number lock
we find out the scripted sequence npc guy has a 3-digit number on his head. it works, but now hes stuck in the weird intermediary door room and is softlocked cus he cant fit in
lots of sadness later theres actually an anti-softlock door that leads to a black void with tons of gates????
he encounters Penis Room 2 full of angels that laugh at him. they disappear, once again only leaving the penises, and the doors he came in through close behind him"

"The Great Cow War of 2045

I remember my dad told me cows were at one time docile creatures, living happily among humans. They were milked, given love, then eventually killed (Happily, though!). Then, were eaten as steak. Everything was happy. In 1899, cows were killed more frequently, causing them to dislike human demand for steak and beef. In 1999 were then put into small, less free range farms than previously, and cows went mad! They began escaping farms, creating Cownia, a small organization in Canada. The cows began constructing wooden nukes that ran off hay, and tanks that shot out hamburger bombs. 2045 was they year that those cows struck America, more specifically, Seattle, my home. I was only 7 years old, and the cows were absolutely terrifying. There tank ‚Äì barns were firing at everything visible. Hay bombs dropped from flying chickens! The town was ruined, and everything would only get worse. 2048, America, Canada, Mexico, and Russia were taken over under cow rule. The cows spread and spread until the cows were overlords of the world. At first, it wasn't so bad under cow rule, but then we not only had to make barns, but entire cites! Then, our cities were destroyed until we had no place to live, but in cow concentration camps. They smelled like hay, cow pies, and cud. We slept in the dirt whist the cows lived in amazing paradise cities. Eventually, humans were never seen again, except those lucky few who found refuge in caves and forest. But the cows are still looking for us, and they will not stop!"

"As we delve into the world of Family Guy, we are confronted with characters who often act in ways that seem less than admirable. Yet, upon closer examination, we find that their actions are not driven by malice, but rather by other motivations that are perfectly reasonable within the context of the show.

In one particular episode, we see Peter, the protagonist of the show, lose his job at the brewery after attempting to chug an industrial tank of beer and failing. This leads to his wife, Lois, having to get a job, and Peter taking on the role of stay-at-home parent.

While out at the park with his baby son, Stewie, Peter is tempted to visit the nearby drunken clam, despite his responsibilities as a parent. The temptation becomes too great when he hears of a group of clowns entering the bar, and he ultimately succumbs to the urge to go check it out.

Despite his flawed behavior, we see Peter as a relatable and emotional character. We witness his struggles as a parent, his fears, and his inner demons. Through his actions, we are reminded that we are all flawed beings, struggling to navigate the complexities of life.

Family Guy serves as a poignant reminder of the human condition, and how we all struggle with the demons within us. It shows us that even the most flawed among us can still be relatable, and that our imperfections do not define us as individuals."
